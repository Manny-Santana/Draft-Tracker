# Fantasy Player Tracker

#### Description: 
The Fantasy player tracker is a project created to aid in decision making with fantasy football teams by presenting vital stats that indicate player performace. Stats that I found most useful to indicate performance for skill positions were Targets by the QB, Rush Attempts and Reception Percentage.
